    <ul>
      <li>I couldn't figure out how to get the search function to return all albums when given an empty object. Only when given no object. EDIT: I came up with something -- was it right?? It seemed to test right... EDIT 2: It did not work.</li>
      <li>Did I overthink it and miss a lot of simpler solutions? It seems like I kind of forced some things to work, but may have just been working around a better solution?</li>
      <li>When iterating through an object, looking for properties, a for...of loop doesn't work quite right, and a basic for-loop format doesn't quite work, but a for...in loop does work. Why is this? I suspect it has something to do with properties and objects being passed by reference...<br />I also did lots of searching on how to check for an empty object, and found some other more concise ways, but I felt to include them would've been cheating, since I don't totally onderstand them (like using Object.keys.length, or iterating with hasOwnProperty).</li>
