    <ul>
      <li>I couldn't figure out how to get the search function to return all albums when given an empty object. Only when given no object. Does it have something to do with the fact that objects are passed by reference? I couldn't create a comparison condition for it that actually worked.</li>
      <li>Did I overthink it and miss a lot of simpler solutions? It seems like I kind of forced some things to work, but may have just been working around a better solution?</li>
